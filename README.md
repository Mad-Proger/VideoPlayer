# VideoPlayer
Multi-thread fullscreen videoplayer using SDL2 and FFmpeg

Current version creates fullscreen window to play video in, but it doesn't handle any window events. As a consequence, it's a bit difficult to close the window untill the video ends.

# Builds
The only build guatanteed to be stable - win64 using gcc.
